## 🎯 SYSTEM PURPOSE

Users verify through Linkvertise and receive a temporary Discord role.

Flow:

1. Staff runs command
2. Bot posts verification panel
3. User clicks **Get Code**
4. Complets Linkvertise
5. Visits `/verify` page
6. Receieves personal code + countdown timer
7. Submits code in Discord
8. Gets role for 3 hours

Main site base:
https://member-net-verify.up.railway.app

⚠️ The app must work on the current domain dynamically.

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE (MAX 4)

```
index.js        → bot + web server + code system
verify.html     → verification page
style.css       → page styling
script.js       → verify page logic
```

---

## 🔑 BOT SETUP

At top of **index.js**:

```
const BOT_TOKEN = "MTQ2OTgwODI3NDc4MTExNDM4OQ.GcY4xX.vLIVUUxkhPP-8o9B0g9g8if9xF5cF3kI1ar7t0";
```

Bot logs in automatically when the app starts.
